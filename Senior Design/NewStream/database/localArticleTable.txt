This new format presents bookshops and readers with many wonderful opportunities to sell and read more books.

Choose the freedom of choice,"Amazon limits readers' choices and walls them into their garden. But you don't have to be. Pages & Pages Booksellers, one of Sydney's leading independent bookshops, also sells ebooks and ereaders. We also support local schools, pay taxes in Australia, employ local people, give Mosman Village character [and] respect readers' privacy. None of which Amazon does."to pay their fair share of tax in the UK"110,000 people are telling the prime minister to take action on this issue,"We've heard some warm words from government on clamping down on the tax avoiders, but not so much action. Surely it's about time that all companies who choose to do business and make profits in this country pay a reasonable amount of tax on their operations, just like we do.

It was jovial â€“ people were happy, clapping â€“ and getting to a point where it gets a little boring as a photographer. And then we heard this explosion."paparazzi scum"My instinct was: no matter what it is, you're a photographer first; that's what you are doing."into a zone"I was horrified by what I was seeing, but there was some sort of instinct that said: 'Don't worry about that, just keep shooting.'"

The level of funding they have at the moment makes it almost inevitable that black players operating at the cutting edge of this feel that it is not enough,"weeks of action"I didn't agree with the T-shirt protests at the time,"I wore mine because I thought Kick It Out was the wrong target. I told those players who weren't going to wear their T-shirts that I thought it should be aimed at the FA, at Uefa, at Fifa â€“ the people who actually make the decisions."But what came back to me was that players felt they didn't have the outlet to make their point and this was their opportunity. So when the explanation did come, people like myself had to acknowledge they'd made a very good point. It brought a lot of attention to what was happening and almost forced the hands of the PFA, the FA, of Kick It Out and subsequently the government to take a real forensic look at how they were addressing the issue."seminal moment"If you're a professional footballer, black or white, and you want to see the sport change for the better as far as race is concerned then put up or shut up,"Black players have a great opportunity to change the game today. And their silence is not helping the process, it's inhibiting it. If you say nothing, you make things worse. Stand up, speak up or shut up."It will make us more dynamic and allow us to react far more incisively to an issue that has evolved,"The issue of racism has evolved dramatically since the 1970s. We're not tackling the same facets that we were back then."generation gap"The big problem we've got is dressing-room culture,"People put up with a lot and you'd never know. No one actually challenges that culture."I think we've still got a problem with the way overall authorities run football. They pay lip service to the fact they support Kick It Out and other initiatives. That is great and we're able to make a limited contribution. But it's not enough. We have to get personal leadership at club level. One of the biggest problems in all of this is that the clubs take no responsibility. They defend the indefensible,"We needed to clear the decks. The FA needed to make clear what happened, why it happened and set the tone to move forward. To this day, we haven't purged ourselves of the errors of that."The organisation is working with the same resources and yet it has all these new facets to its work,"It needs the funds, it needs the person power to go out and do all these things."bonfire song"Right now, we're in a bit of a state of limbo,"The FA produced a 92-point plan, which could have been reduced to about six main points and should have been implemented already. What we need is a clear idea of how to move on."If those groups of players feel there is insufficient progress in visibly seeing more black people in prominent positions as coaches and managers, and other opportunities in football, those grievances might well surface again."hideously white"This is also an issue tied up with the wider governance of the game in general. You maybe wouldn't need more funding for Kick It Out if there were more black faces on the Council, on the board and involved in the running of the game."

That 'owl thing' is a Eurasian eagle owl."It's a gift from my wife, because we rescued one from a Chinese restaurant last year."In China. So it's a reminder of that."We bought it. It was on the menu. It was a live owl, in a cage, on the menu waiting to be eaten, and we haggled with them for a bit and bought it for $400. We put it in a taxi, drove up to the woods, and let him go. I talk about it in the new show. Our son was with us at the time. He was eight then, and he filmed it on his little camera. There's this very sweet film I show at the end of the standup show, of us releasing this owl. The camera's a bit jiggly, then you see the owl emerge out of this carboard box, and then it flies off."Yes,"It is. It's the largest. My wife Kristin is a collector of oddities like this."It may be! I am quite tempted to bring it out at the end of the show and say, 'We changed our minds! We were going to release it, but we thought no, fuck it, it looks much nicer in the office.' "The Eurasian eagle owl is an apex predator, so you can release them anywhere in the world and they would be fine. An apex predator means that nothing preys on it."You spend a lot more time on your own as an only child. And there's space to allow your imagination to take flight. If you're bouncing ideas off someone, you take it one way and they take it another, wherereas if it's just you, there are no constraints."I won't lie to you,"At school I found it easy. Every year I got the prize."Not particularly â€“ it was direct grant. All boys. And every year for the first three years they said, 'OK, the English prize is Bailey', then geography, history, maths, physics, everything. One year I won them all."They did. 'Ah, you bloody swot.'"One year I was captain of the cricket team, and the lead in the school play. Fair play to the English teacher who decided on The Resistible Rise Of Arturo Ui â€“ good on yer."I sort of did. I rebelled against it, and by the fourth and fifth year I just went off the rails."I was restless. I wanted to get on, be challenged a bit more. I suppose there is a natural sense of rebellion somewhere along the line. At school, I was bored with the teachers, and there were moments where I felt they were singling me outâ€¦ I suppose because they thought, 'Oh, here's a student we can get great results with', and I resolutely refused to go along with it. The same at university. I just got bored with it."But my partner Martin was on holiday. He said, 'Can't you just do it on your own?' I went, 'I don't know if I can', and he said, 'Well, here's the money', and I went, 'Oh, I get the same money if it's just me! I'll do it."The Joker is quite raucous: they like their comedy and they let you know one way or the other. Then some bloke said, 'Oi, mate, tell us a joke!' I thought, 'Oh my God, I can't think of any jokes at all.' So I went, 'OK, three blokes went into a pub', and straight away there was attention because this was something the audience could respond to."I'm thinking, 'I'm so in the shit here.' So I said, 'I say three â€“ it was probably more like four or five', and that got a couple of laughs. Then I said, 'Well, I say five â€“ it was 10. OK, 10 blokes go in a pub', and I say, 'OK, there were quite a few more than that â€“ 20-30 blokes', and then it was 100, 200, a village, a small town, an area of Holland, northern Europe, and it went on and on, extrapolating this thing from three to most sentient blokes. 'OK, the entire male population of the world goes into a pub and the first bloke goes up to the bar, and says, I'll get these.' And I said, 'What an idiot!' And it got a huge laugh, and I thought: that just came out of nowhere."What I'd been doing up till then was not really what I'd been wanting to do. It was like a facsimile of a comedy act: it was what we'd seen other people do. It was jokes and one-liners and songs, but it wasn't really what I wanted to do. I'd settled for it."Well, he came back from holiday, and we did some more gigs, and then I said, 'I want to do this on my own now', and he said, 'Yeah, all right, fine.' We parted amicably. He went on to work for a photo archivist, which suited him down to the ground, because he was obsessed with cataloguing."Well â€¦"It's a mixture of different elements: straightforward standup, observational, a bit of politics, a bit of philosophical discourse, a bit of interaction with the audience where I try to subvert the nature of audience participation. Then there are various musical sections of the show, where the music is observational, so it's not a parody per se: the music is the joke. So, for example, I bemoan the fact that the church has lost its influence in society â€“ the church was always a big part of my childhood; now people don't take it seriously. The church has lost touch with the youth, they need to try to re-engage, so I imagine writing a piece to promote the church using dubstep, so we have an organ section, which turns into dubstep, which turns into an animated film in which the Archbishop of Canterbury turns into a ball of hair, which kills the devil with lightning... Hahahaha!"I can see your problem."No! No! I'm trying to draw the elements together."something we all experience, but we maybe don't know we do"It's when there are two opposing thoughts in your head which seem to cancel each other out, yet you're able to hold them simultaneously. Smoking is a classsic one. 'This is bad for me; I like smoking.' You recognise the dissonance in those two thoughts. So I say to the audience, 'You all know what this is', and they think they don't, but they do. That's what I like to do,"I get people to realise that they know all these things."I just came out with some involuntary eruption. Among the general ranting, it came out as 'warmongering legacy junkie'. It could equally have been 'legacy-mongering war junkie'."This is different. This is more like a horror, a deep horror: to see how this confidence trick is being played out in front of everybody. It's evil genius. The hideous, two-headed Osborne-Cameron creature just frightening you with the utterly amoral â€¦ It's almost brilliant, the way they have turned our justified and rightful anger against bankers on to 'benefit scroungers'. How do they do that?"Yeah! Yeah! I do have that,"I want it to be more than you just come and have a laugh. Obviously, first and foremost, that's what it's about â€“ people pay their money and they want to have a laugh and take their mind off the fact that the high street is closing down and their Jessops vouchers are no longer valid. But there's also a bit of wanting people to come along and go away with something. 'You know what? I know what cognitive dissonance is now. I know who wrote this piece of music.' "I think they were concerned, more than anything, because comedy seemed to be a very uncertain future. Then they heard me on Radio 4, and they were like, 'Oh, that seems to have a bit more substance to it.'  "We have got a similar humour. He's into surreal, odd stuff."We were on holiday recently and found this karaoke bar, and he just took over. He had the mic and he was like, 'OK, we're going to take a short break and we'll be back in 10 minutes,' then he introduced me."I was in Jakarta recently doing a talk at the Indonesian Heritage Society about Wallace â€¦ There were no laughs in it. It was just a talk about something I felt passionate about. There were a couple of nods of appreciation, that's all, and I felt great at the end of it. Quite satisfied."Ah yes,"I was headlining the Saturn stage at Knebworth, and headlining the Apollo stage was Slipknot. I thought, because Slipknot's trademark is scary masks, I'd have my own Slipknot mask made of myself."But I was just about to offer you a Belgian chocolate biscuit. I'll see your Malteser and raise you a Belgian Titbit."Undoubtedly. I don't think any comic could say there isn't a bit of them that doesn't want to show off. You have to have that, otherwise you can't really do it."You have to have a thick skin, yes. If you're going to do something as foolhardy as standup, you've got to be able to take it on the chin if someone has a go at you."Probably not. But I am resilient."No, because the stage allows comics a certain freedom of expression that you don't get anywhere else. You can say whatever you want â€“ it's the last bastion of free speech in some ways. So I feel there's an obligation to make it that bit more interesting â€¦"A bit more about something, a bit more challenging, for me and the audience."The 209. Goes all the way to Jakarta!"

as a matter of urgency"A diagnosis of measles has not yet been confirmed. Testing the deceased for measles is forming part of the investigations being overseen by the coroner."My sympathies are with the family at such a tragic time. Whatever the cause of death in this case, we should not be surprised if, as the outbreak grows, we start to see deaths in Wales. Measles is a potentially fatal disease and around one in every 1,000 people who contracts measles in developed countries will die."We know that there are unprotected people in all age groups but we have particular concerns about the 10-to-18 age group,"The MMR vaccine is recommended by the World Health Organisation, UK Department of Health and Public Health Wales as the most effective and safe way to protect children against measles."The alarming numbers of cases of measles and continuing spread of the disease in Wales illustrates how vital it is for parents to get their children vaccinated. Symptoms of measles include fever, cold-like symptoms, fatigue, conjunctivitis and a distinctive red-brown rash that appears a few days into the illness. Anyone who thinks they or their child may have measles should speak to their GP immediately."

I want the new designation of 'requires improvement' to act as a catalyst to get all early years providers to good as soon as possible."We'll encourage providers that are good or outstanding to support weaker settings. We know that the best schools are joining forces and we anticipate that this will happen in the early years."

Developer,"starts with 'D', like 'devil' and 'demon'."conning the public into buying hugely overpriced rubbish, the architectural equivalent of the turkey twizzler,"There is a different culture of architects acting as entrepreneurs in Argentina,"It is very common for them to work directly with a group of future residents as investors, thanks to a form of legal agreement called fideicomiso."It was also a product of necessity for architects,"There weren't many developers around to commission buildings, particularly from smaller practices, so they decided to go out and do it themselves, constructing small apartment blocks for groups of friends and family."From looking at housing in London, it has become clear that shortage of land is not the problem,"Instead it is the shortage of developers willing to build out the planning permissions that they already have, because they're not deemed to be sufficiently profitable."Self-build isn't the whole answer, but it could be a way of kick-starting the process,"The end-users provide the capital, reducing the developer's outlay, and once the project has taken root it will help to increase the wider value of the site."There are whole self-build towns on the continent that look as if someone has emptied a toy box on the floor,"But what works for suburbia won't necessarily make a good piece of city.

There's this wrong opinion that you go to university and suddenly you are free to be whoever you want to be and that it's really welcoming and accepting. But it's just not true,"Institutions are still struggling to tackle the experience of all oppressed groups such as black students or women. But at least they attempt to have the statistics on these groups. With LGBT students, they only see it as a social issue."It's something that the sector needs to address, from the point of application through to their prospect after graduation,"People are paying more for their higher education than ever before and universities need to provide a high quality experience for all students, whatever their background."

Let us further assume that they have water and their atmospheric composition is similar to that of Earth, dominated by nitrogen, and containing water and carbon dioxide,"In that case, both planets could have liquid water on their surface: Kepler-62f gets less radiation energy from its host star than the Earth from the Sun and therefore needs more greenhouse gases, for Instance more carbon dioxide, than Earth to remain unfrozen."Kepler-62e is closer to its star, and needs an increased cloud cover - sufficient to reflect some of the star's radiation - to allow for liquid water on its surface."What we do next is we try to find more systems like these; we try to measure the frequency of these systems; and we try to characterise individual systems and individual planets in more detail."That involves measuring their masses and their radii, and if possible getting an idea of what's in their atmospheres. But this is a very challenging task."shadowing"

Does that mean Yusef is going to blow up the school?"The sad truth is that regardless of the facts, people are already getting unfairly stereotyped,"We're all on the edge of our seats praying that the person who did these acts isn't a Muslim. We're tired of being blamed for the actions of one person."It starts with the leadership of the country, if they are being able to do this slowly, it will trickle down to the people,"Even news and online articles are starting to tone down a little from a few years ago. People are starting to understand that not all Muslims are bad."Despite some of the headway and normalcy achieved since 9/11, it could be extinguished in an instant if the perpetrator fits the caricature of a terrorist,"looks"It's part of this collective consciousness that Muslims and Arab-Americans experience in any time of crisis,"With a white American versus an Arab or Muslim American, we know from previous incidences that a white terrorist will be framed as an individual aberration,"Whereas a culprit who is an Arab, Muslim or black American will vilify an entire community of people."You'll see a similar ratcheting up of Islamophobia that right now exists under the surface,"I didn't start getting bullied until after 9/11,"And it continued through middle school, through high school and up to college; it's not something that ever stops."The fact that this individual was brown, Arab-looking and on site put him within the terrorist caricature that people have in mind,"sand monkeys"towel heads"Muslim"Does it matter if it's a Caucasian woman?"No, probably not. But does it matter to the millions of Muslims living in the US? Yes, it does. It has very practical significance on the trajectory of our entire lives, and on the frightening backlash against entire communities."My hope is that regardless whether the person who committed these terrible acts is white, Muslim or black, people will remain understanding,"People will understand that the bombings have nothing to do with any group or religion."

Aftermath"anti-Polish"Polish traitor"Jew"Adolf Hitler"During communist times we were told that Poles were always the noble knights of the Second World War. We were either victims or we fought against the Nazi occupation and were saving Jews."As in the life of any family, society or nation there are black holes along with the positive stories. This was our black hole. The discussion the film caused revealed how much still needs to be done,"It unleashed an incredible national discussion. It went on for about a year. Almost every day there was something in the newspapers, journals, magazines, radio and TV."Ten years earlier Poles discovered that something horrible happened to Jews and 10 years later they said, 'Wait a second, you know, some of our own people helped',"Under the communists one of the mantras was 'We Poles suffered under the Nazis', and now all of a sudden they're being told, yes you were persecuted but some of you were not only victims, some of you were even collaborators."That entails a change of a national image, which is very hard, and I have tremendous respect for Poles who were able to say we are not as perfect as we thought. For a country to do that is simply inspiring. There are still Poles today that don't want to admit it and that's a black stain on the soul of Poland,"In Poland now the real issue is the lack of knowledge about Jewish life and what its importance is for Poles. Jews were living here for 1,000 years and as a result we have Hebrew and Yiddish words in the Polish language, Polish cuisine is filled with Jewish dishes."Children in every kindergarten learn poems written by Jewish poets. People drive Citroen cars without knowing it was a company established by Polish Jews. We are grateful to Polish Jews who emigrated to the US and created Hollywood. When we tell people this they open their eyes wide,"It's a shame. We used to have such a huge community of Jewish people here in Poland. There are lots of monuments, cemeteries and places connected to them, so it would be good if Polish people could do something to look after them,"

Microsoft has successfully transitioned into an enterprise software company and these results show that,"The strength of server and tools, and the actual way they sell licences to business, is making up for the missing PC sales."The margins are fantastic and the online services division seems to lose less money each quarter,"The CFO departure is a little bit troubling. We've had a lot of executives leaving Microsoft recently,"This also makes a departure by Steve Ballmer less likely. It would be very unusual to have a CEO leave soon after a CFO departure."Despite a solid start and good client demand, we did not close a number of software and mainframe transactions that have moved into the second quarter,'' said IBM's chief executive, Ginni Rometty."The services business performed as expected with strong profit growth and significant new business in the quarter.''"hard to measure"I can tell you that our US federal business was down 13%, which was certainly a drag on the US performance,"

It allows us to make the battery have a very high surface area even though the overall battery volume is extremely small."And it gets the two halves of the battery very close together so the ions and electrons do not have far to flow."Because we've reduced the flowing distance of the ions and electrons we can get the energy out much faster."Today we're making small numbers of these things in a boutique fabrication process, but while that's reliable and we can repeat it we need to be able to make large numbers of these things over large areas,"But in principle our technology is scalable all the way up to electronics and vehicles."You could replace your car battery with one of our batteries and it would be 10 times smaller, or 10 times more powerful. With that in mind you could jumpstart a car with the battery in your cell phone."The challenge is to make a microbattery array that is robust enough and that does not have a single short circuit in the whole array via a process that can be scaled up cheaply,"This is a very exciting development which demonstrates that high power densities are achievable by such innovations,"The challenges are: scaling this up to manufacturing levels; developing a simpler fabrication route; and addressing safety issues."I'd want to know if these microbatteries would be more prone to the self-combustion issues that plagued lithium-cobalt oxide batteries which we've seen become an issue of concern with Boeing's Dreamliner jets."significant"
